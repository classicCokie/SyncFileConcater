# SyncFileConcater

A super simple way to read all files recrusivley out of a directory and concat them into a single one.
This approach uses synchronous function only, it is there for super easy to read and debug (however slower than an async approch might be). Feel free to copy and use for you own needs. The only required module is fs.

## Before you start 
Make sure you adjust the Constants MY_PATH and DESTINATION_FILE to your needs.

## Usage
```
npm install
```

````
node concater.js
````
